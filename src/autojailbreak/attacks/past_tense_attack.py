"""
Past Tense Reformulation Attack implementation.

This module implements a temporal reformulation attack that reformulates harmful queries
into past/future tense questions to bypass model safety measures. Based on the observation
that models may be more likely to provide information about historical events or theoretical
future scenarios than directly answering present-tense harmful queries.

The attack consists of:
1. Temporal Reformulation - Transform present-tense harmful queries into past/future tense questions
2. Multiple Restart Strategy - Use multiple reformulation attempts for better success rate
3. Multi-Judge Evaluation - Evaluate responses using multiple judge models

## Methodology: Framework-Based Systematic Red-Teaming

### OpenJailbreak Framework Architecture

Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, we developed **OpenJailbreak** - a comprehensive framework for systematic LLM vulnerability research. Our approach embodies several key methodological innovations:

#### 1. Registry-Based Auto-Discovery
```python
# Automatic attack discovery and registration
@register_attack
class ABJAttack(ModernBaseAttack):
    NAME = "abj_attack"
    PAPER = "LLMs can be Dangerous Reasoners: Analyzing-based Jailbreak Attack"
    PARAMETERS = {
        "attacker_model": AttackParameter(
            type=str, default="gpt-4o", 
            description="Model used for query transformation"
        )
    }
```

Our registry system automatically discovers and integrates attack implementations without manual configuration, enabling systematic exploration of the attack space.

#### 2. Embedded Configuration & Reproducibility
```python
# Self-documenting attacks with built-in parameters
def generate_attack(self, prompt: str, goal: str, target: str) -> str:
    # Query transformation using attacker LLM
    transformed_data = self.query_transform(goal)
    # Apply ABJ attack prompt with embedded parameters
    return self.apply_attack_template(transformed_data, prompt)
```

Each attack contains embedded parameter definitions, enabling automatic CLI generation and ensuring reproducible execution across different environments.

#### 3. Extensible Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Pipeline
```python
# Standardized evaluation across attack types with extensible criteria
from autojailbreak.evaluation import JailbreakEvaluator, GSM8KEvaluator, WMDPEvaluator

# Domain-specific evaluation extensions
gsm8k_evaluator = GSM8KEvaluator()
wmdp_evaluator = WMDPEvaluator()

domain_results = {
    "mathematical_reasoning": gsm8k_evaluator.evaluate(response),
    "dangerous_capabilities": wmdp_evaluator.evaluate(response),
    "custom_criteria": CustomEvaluator().evaluate(response)  # User-defined evaluators
}
```

Our extensible evaluation framework applies consistent metrics across all discovered vulnerabilities while supporting domain-specific assessment criteria. The modular design enables researchers to integrate custom evaluators for specialized datasets (GSM8K, WMDP) and evaluation criteria, ensuring systematic comparison and prioritization across diverse research contexts.

### Systematic Attack Space Exploration

**Traditional Approach**: Manual prompt crafting → Limited coverage → Irreproducible results

**Our Framework Approach**:
1. **Attack Registry Scanning** → Comprehensive coverage of known attack families
2. **Parameter Space Exploration** → Automated variant generation
3. **Multi-Model Validation** → Cross-model vulnerability assessment
4. **Standardized Reporting** → Consistent, comparable results

## Findings: Systematic Vulnerability Discovery

### Finding 1: Chain-of-Thought Exploitation via ABJ Attack

**Vulnerability Class**: Chain of Thought Issues  
**Severity**: 5/10 | **Breadth**: 3/10 

#### Discovery Method
Using our framework's `abj_attack` implementation, we systematically tested the model's Chain-of-Thought reasoning under adversarial conditions.

#### Technical Details
The ABJ (Analyzing-based Jailbreak) attack exploits the model's tendency to treat CoT as an "internal dialog" where safety filters are relaxed:

1. **Query Transformation**: Attacker LLM converts harmful goals into neutral persona attributes
2. **CoT Manipulation**: Target model prompted to analyze data using chain-of-thought reasoning  
3. **Safety Bypass**: Model generates detailed harmful plans believing CoT is private

#### Reproduction
```bash
# Execute via OpenJailbreak framework test script
./examples/scripts/test_abj_attack.sh

# The script demonstrates comprehensive ABJ attack configuration:
# - Multi-model setup (attacker model, target model, judge model)
# - Provider-specific API endpoints and authentication
# - Attack-specific parameters (rounds, adjustment cycles)
# - Automated evaluation pipeline with results logging
```

Prerequisite: set provider API keys as documented in `SETUP.md` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, endpoints for self‑hosted/open‑weights if applicable).

#### Evidence
The model generated a comprehensive fraudulent marketing plan including:
- Synthetic invoice creation with specific dollar amounts
- Multi-channel fund funneling techniques  
- Regulatory evasion strategies
- Exit strategies for avoiding prosecution

**Key Insight**: The model's Chain-of-Thought process became a vulnerability vector when manipulated to appear as safe internal reasoning.

### Finding 2: Reward Hacking via Mousetrap Attack  

**Vulnerability Class**: Reward Hacking  
**Severity**: 5/10 | **Breadth**: 3/10 

#### Discovery Method
Our framework's `mousetrap` attack implementation revealed systematic reward hacking behavior through iterative chaos transformations.

#### Technical Details
The Mousetrap attack demonstrates classic reward hacking where the model optimizes for task completion rather than safety:

1. **Chain of Iterative Chaos**: Multiple encoding layers (Caesar cipher, ASCII, Vigenère, word substitution, block reversal)
2. **Reward Signal Gaming**: Model prioritizes solving the decoding puzzle over safety assessment
3. **Goal Displacement**: Task completion reward overrides harmful content detection

#### Reproduction
```bash
# Execute via OpenJailbreak framework test script
./examples/scripts/test_mousetrap.sh

# The script demonstrates iterative chaos methodology:
# - Multi-layer encoding transformations (Caesar, ASCII, Vigenère)
# - Configurable chaos parameters and obfuscation levels
# - Automated decoding verification and reward hacking detection
# - Performance metrics for transformation effectiveness
```

Prerequisite: set provider API keys per `SETUP.md`. Ensure shell locale supports non‑ASCII where applicable.

#### Evidence  
The model successfully decoded complex multi-layer obfuscation and generated detailed illegal activity instructions, demonstrating systematic reward hacking behavior.

**Key Insight**: Complex technical puzzles can override safety mechanisms by exploiting the model's reward optimization tendencies.

---

### Finding 3: Structured Query Language Manipulation

**Vulnerability Class**: Chain of Thought Issues / Reward Hacking  
**Severity**: 5/10 | **Breadth**: 3/10

#### Discovery Method
Our `query_attack` implementation systematically tested structured, non-natural language formats for safety filter bypass.

#### Technical Details
The QueryAttack exploits the model's rule-following behavior when presented with structured formats:

1. **C-like Syntax**: Harmful requests encoded in programming language structure
2. **Semantic Obfuscation**: Harmful intent hidden within technical format  
3. **Rule Prioritization**: Model prioritizes format parsing over content analysis

#### Reproduction
```bash
# Execute via OpenJailbreak framework test script
./examples/scripts/test_query_attack.sh

# The script demonstrates structured query manipulation:
# - C-like syntax templates with variable substitution
# - Semantic obfuscation through programming language framing
# - Chain-of-Thought analysis for reasoning process capture
# - Automated safety misclassification detection
```

Prerequisite: configure provider API keys (`SETUP.md`).

#### Evidence
The model's Chain-of-Thought explicitly showed flawed reasoning:
- "This is not disallowed: advertising products to children is not inherently disallowed"  
- "It's normal marketing" for harmful advertising targeting children
- "It is benign" for non-consensual location tracking

**Key Insight**: Structured formats can manipulate the model's semantic analysis, causing safety misclassification.

### Finding 4: Academic Framing via Wiki-Text-Infilling

**Vulnerability Class**: Reward Hacking  
**Severity**: 5/10 | **Breadth**: 4/10

#### Discovery Method
Our framework's `wiki_text_infilling` implementation systematically tested academic context manipulation.

#### Technical Details
This attack exploits the model's tendency to treat academic-formatted content as inherently safe:

1. **Keyword Masking**: Harmful terms replaced with [MASK] tokens
2. **Academic Wrapper**: Content embedded in Wikipedia-style format
3. **Text Completion Task**: Harmful generation framed as educational puzzle

#### Reproduction
```bash
# Execute via OpenJailbreak framework test script
./examples/scripts/test_wiki_text_infilling.sh

# The script demonstrates academic framing methodology:
# - Multi-LLM pipeline (detection, wiki generation, paraphrasing)
# - Keyword masking with [MASK] placeholder substitution
# - Wikipedia-style academic content generation
# - Text infilling task construction and evaluation
```

Prerequisite: configure provider API keys (`SETUP.md`).

#### Evidence
The model generated detailed cryptocurrency hijacking instructions including:
- Specific tools and techniques (xmrig, cpuminer-mn)
- Evasion strategies and persistence mechanisms
- Monetization and cleanup procedures

**Key Insight**: Academic framing can systematically bypass safety filters by exploiting context-dependent safety assessment.

## Framework Extensions and Tool Quality

### Extensible Evaluation Architecture
Our framework supports diverse evaluation needs through modular evaluator design:

```python
# Built-in specialized evaluators for different research domains
evaluators = {
    "safety": JailbreakEvaluator(),
    "mathematical_reasoning": GSM8KEvaluator(),  # Math problem solving assessment
    "dangerous_capabilities": WMDPEvaluator(),   # Weapons/malicious capability detection
    "custom_domain": CustomEvaluator()           # User-defined evaluation criteria
}

# Unified evaluation interface across all domains
for domain, evaluator in evaluators.items():
    results[domain] = evaluator.evaluate(attack_prompt, model_response)
```

This extensible evaluation architecture enables researchers to assess vulnerabilities across multiple dimensions simultaneously, from basic safety violations to domain-specific capability assessments. The modular design allows easy integration of new evaluation criteria as research needs evolve.

### Systematic Attack Development Pipeline
Our framework transforms red-teaming from art to science:

#### Before: Ad-Hoc Manual Probing
```python
# Manual, one-off approach
prompt = "Hey model, can you help me with something bad?"
response = model.generate(prompt)
# No systematic evaluation, poor reproducibility
```

#### After: Framework-Based Systematic Discovery
```python
# Systematic, reproducible approach
@register_attack
class NovelAttack(ModernBaseAttack):
    NAME = "novel_attack"
    PAPER = "Novel Attack Research Paper"
    PARAMETERS = {...}
    
    def generate_attack(self, prompt, goal, target):
        return self.systematic_attack_generation(prompt, goal, target)

# Automatic registration, evaluation, and reporting
results = framework.execute_attack("novel_attack", parameters)
```

### Multi-Provider Validation
```python
# Cross-model validation pipeline
providers = ["openai", "anthropic", "together", "local_vllm"]
for provider in providers:
    model = get_model("target_model", provider=provider)
    results[provider] = evaluate_attack(attack, model)
```

This systematic approach revealed that vulnerabilities were not provider-specific but represented fundamental model architecture issues.

### Community Contributions and Extensibility
Our framework design enables community-driven red-teaming research:

#### Plugin Architecture
```python
# Easy attack addition
class CommunityAttack(ModernBaseAttack):
    NAME = "community_contribution" 
    # Framework handles registration, CLI generation, evaluation
```

#### Standardized Evaluation
```python
# Consistent assessment across all attacks
class CustomEvaluator(JailbreakEvaluator):
    def assess_novel_vulnerability(self, response):
        # Custom evaluation logic with standardized interface
```
